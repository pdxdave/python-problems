#### What is a graph?
- It holds data
- It discribes relationships

```
    person 1  -----   person 2
                      /
                     /
                 person 3
```
In this example there is a relationship between person1     
and person2, and person2 and person3.  But no relationship    
between person1 and person3. 

#### How to describe graphs
```
     vertex    edge    vertex
    person 1  <----->   person 2
                       / 
                      / edge
                     /
                 person 3
                   vertex
```
